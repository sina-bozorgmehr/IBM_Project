<P>INTRODUCTION</P>

Relocating is always a complicated and hard to do. In this era, finding a better paid job and moving to a new place is constantly happening amongst population especially in younger generation. People are looking for more stable jobs and depending on the industry they are in, there are hot spots that they can find more jobs with better salaries that can persuade them to relocate to a new city or even a new state. Finding the right job is the first step. When people are going to relocate, the first thing they are obsessed with is the neighborhood they are going to live. To choose the right place to live, they consider the housing rate, school ranks if they have children, crime rate, amenities, grocery stores, etc. 
Another important factor to choose the right place is the commute distance to work. Specially in more populated cities with more traffic, people tend to live as close as possible to their workplace. So, if you look at it, there are multiple factors involved in the decision-making process which sometimes makes it tough. This problem gets even bigger when we are talking about metropolitan areas like Los Angeles where commuting from north west to the south west pf the city can take up to 3 hours in traffic jam. 

It will be much easier if we could cluster the neighborhoods based on the involved factors in the problem and narrow down the choice range. In this Project, I will try to do this by:
1.	 Clustering the Los Angeles county neighborhoods based on their distance to a specific workplace and rent rate and then
2.	Based on the userâ€™s input, score each neighborhood in the cluster of choice, and select the one with highest score as the new neighborhood to move in. 
With this solution, one can make an easier choice when relocating to Los Angeles county for a new job.
